=== Starboard

Provides the ability to track note worthy posts in a separate channel, identified by the post target `starboard`, because the pins within a channel are limited to 50.
This feature works by users reacting to a message with the appropriate emote. By default this is `&#11088;`, but can be changed via the emote `star`.
There is a configurable threshold a message needs to reach in order to be posted to starboard.
The post in the starboard is continuously updated and depending on the current star count an associated emote is displayed.

=== Repost detection and tracking

This feature can be used to detect whether an image has been posted before on the server. Images are compared by the hash stored in the database, which makes it very strict.
In order to calculate the hash, the image needs to be downloaded. It is possible to show a leaderboard of the most reposting users. Both of these features can be changed via feature modes.
If a reaction has been detected a reaction will be added to the post. If a message contains multiple or the detected repost is not the first image in the message a reaction containing digit indicating the position of the repost will be added.
For example if the repost is the second image in a message, a reaction representing the digit two will be added.

While it can be configured that the feature is only active in certain channels, the detection whether an image is a repost checks all previously posted images from the server (given they have been posted in a channel where the repost check is active).
