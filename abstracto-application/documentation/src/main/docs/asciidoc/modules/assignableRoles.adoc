=== Assignable roles

This feature enables creating and maintaining so-called 'assignable role places' (ARP). These places are messages at which buttons are added, and when a member clicks such a button, a configured role is assigned to the user.
A place can be disabled, which causes the buttons to become disabled. Such places can be made 'unique', which means that users can only have one role assigned at one point in time.

There exist different types of ARPs: `DEFAULT`, or `BOOSTERÂ´. The `BOOSTER` type comes with special functionalities: if a member clicked a button, the bot will evaluate whether the member has boosted the server and reject if not. These 'booster assigned roles' will be removed once the member stopped boosting.

Deleting the actual role behind an assignable role causes the assignable role place to become non-functional: the button will remain and can still be clicked, but users will receive an error message. In this case you can remove such a role via the command `removeRoleFromAssignableRolePlace`.

Move an ARP to another channel::
* Usage: `moveAssignableRolePlace <name> <newChannel>`
